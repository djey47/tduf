### What you will need to run TDUF
* Make sure Java apps can be run:
    - Please uninstall any Java Runtime < 8
    - [Update / Install Java 8 Runtime Environment](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html)
    - Linux users with OpenJDK8: you'll need to get **openjfx** package.
* Make sure .net apps can be run, as well (if TDUMT/TDUPE actually run, you're fine):
    - Windows: check if .net Framework 2.0 is installed
    - Linux: check if Mono 2.0 is installed, otherwise you will have to get **mono-complete** package.


### Running Database Editor!
- Launch DatabaseEditor.cmd from Windows explorer / DatabaseEditor.sh from Linux
- In DatabaseEditor, browse location of TDU database BNK or JSON files. Load (may take a while)
- At first loading, select real TDU game path when asked 
- IMPORTANT: if you just updated TDU Database files with a mod, you should always *Clear database cache* from advanced settings! Then reload.
- Make your changes. Save (may take a while)
- Database is repacked automatically.


### Running Launcher!
- Launch Launcher.cmd from Windows explorer / Launcher.sh from Linux


### (Advanced) Running Command Line tools!
- Open console (cmd in Windows or bash-compatible in Linux)
- `cd` to TDUF directory
- For Linux users, apply aliases: `source ./linux-aliases`
- Type and launch `help`
- Follow instructions.
